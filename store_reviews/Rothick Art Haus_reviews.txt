Love that this gallery is in Anaheim and not in LA! :) It's a small gallery but they really jam pack it with art.

I've been here twice for 2 art shows:

**POPCade!**
Came on opening night and it was a great turnout. This show centered around videogames and there was a ton of great artists that contributed to the show. The most memorable was the BioShocker which was the Operations Game remade into the style of BioShock. It was so much fun playing it! I managed to remove all the pieces without getting shocked, and then I shocked myself deliberately to test. And yes it was a bit intense!

**Moon Crisis**
For this Sailor Moon themed show, I didn't attend on opening night because I knew it would be VERY popular. From the photos, there was even a line that wrapped around the corner! I viewed it on their special Sunday time, which was more leisurely. Again, top caliber artists that contributed to the show, like Glenn Arthur and Ann Marcellino. There was even an arcade cabinet! :) 

I overhead that there will be a Miyazaki-themed show sometime in the fall so I'm EXTREMELY excited to see that :)

Parking is nearby street or walk a bit further from the parking structure.

As far as I know they're only open on Saturdays from 12-5 PM so double-check before you go!

I came here last year for their Studio Ghibli exhibit. It's a small art gallery in Anaheim with street parking only, so I parked at a nearby plaza and walked over. The artwork they had on display was beautiful! I loved walking around the room and seeing various artists' tribute to Miyazaki and his creations. I would have loved to buy one of the prints on sale but unfortunately I did not have the budget for it.

I can't find anything about this gallery anymore so I fear it is closed, which is unfortunate since it was a cute gallery. Unfortunately I was never able to come back since it's in the OC and I am not.

I attended the Studio Ghibli art exhibit a few weeks ago with my +1.  All of the artwork paid tribute to Hayao Miyazaki and his films.  The Rothick Art Haus is pretty small.  The gallery is essentially one room.  We attended the opening night party and there was an hour long wait.  Since we were coming from LA, we stopped by and decided to wait.  They had artists outside the gallery selling copies of their wares.  You could also contact the gallery to buy any of the originals.  Some were already spoken for but some were still for sale.  If you're a fan of Hayao Miyazaki, it was worth checking out.

This is a sweet little gallery in Downtown Anaheim that always has great shows. I definitely recommend following them via social media to see what great themes they have coming up.

I recently came for their Popcade exhibit during the Anaheim Art Crawl and was blown away by it's awesomeness. Because it was an homage to classic gaming, there were a lot of great Super Mario pieces of different mediums with my favorite being a piece in a Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas fashion. Other fave games included Street Fighter 2, Donkey Kong and a variety of other nostalgic favorites - each with a clever twist to them.

The place gets packed as it's one of the more popular spots during the event. Just be patient, once you get in, it's definitely worth it. You might not spend too much time inside, but you'll definitely appreciate all of the cool things you see.

The galleries are free and there is parking on the street near the lofts on Harbor. If that's full, there are plenty of free spaces in the adjacent Center Street structure.

Wow this place is small! Came by here last Saturday with my husband for the Moon Crisis Sailor Moon tribute (for free). I remember watching Sailor Moon when I was in jr. high and elementary school (yep, I'm pretty old) and so when I found out about this art tribute, I just had to go and of course I dragged my husband with me (gotta love him for coming). 

None of the previous reviews for this little art place mentioned that it was small, so I was surprised it was on the small side. But nonetheless, it was still a pretty cool place to check out whatever featured art is on display. I love all of the different interpretations and renditions of what ever the artists made of the loved Japanese anime, but of course I still prefer the classic look of Sailor Moon and wished I would see more of the artist work of that. 

Since we were not the only ones who wanted to come to this opening night's art tribute, we waited in line for quite a while. The line was around the building and then some, but still worth the wait to get in. There were also vendor tables outside of the art house selling copies of their art work and other cute Sailor Moon related items. 

Overall, really enjoyed myself and would come back here for another featured art exhibit that would peak my interest (which is great this place does not charge admission to check out their exhibits). By the way, this place is located in the Downtown Anaheim, Center Street Promenade. Specifically, this place is located right next to PokiNometry. There is some street parking on Harbor Blvd and also a structure that is a few blocks down.

Came here to see the Ghibli exhibition left so incredibly disappointed. The venue was small. Imagine having an art gallery in your bedroom and then cramming 50 people in there...yeah it was bad. They had a/c but with the swarm of humans invading a small space it did it uncomfortably warm. So bummed out :(

This place was popping last night. Loved it. 'Twas the opening night for the Tim Burton Show. Lots of cool artwork, music, free sangria (donations), an Edward Scissor hands outside for photo ops, and a performance from 'Jack Skellington'. Good times at a pretty cool gallery.

Live close so I've seen a few showings, Way cool stuff if you're into the macabre scene. Defiantly worth a look anyway if you ain't. Check out the website to see if it is for you. Open during ACE (Art Crawl Experience) to general public. I thought it was interesting especially the Xmas exhibit. Forget what it was called but it was cool.

They have great art by amazing artists! I love their shows.

Every month is something new. They never disappoint. The gallery owners are a couple and they are amazing! I bought a piece from the woman Kelli (spelled wrong i think) that owns it.

Came by during Anaheim's art walk to see their circus/sideshow exhibition, Behind the Striped Curtain. They seemed to have the most going on of all the galleries and museums in the area with their own Dr. Sketchy's freak show with live models, carnival games, and an open bar. 

The art they had on display was top quality. Sadly, with how many groups were hanging out and chatting, it was difficult to see all of it. Oh well. 

Looking through past exhibitions, I'm amazed by what they had, and yet sad to have not visited before. I won't be making that mistake again.

Rothick Art Haus is a gallery located within the Harbor Lofts in Anaheim.. I really do not know Anaheim for I never come here but I will for Rothick.. If you don't have any plans this Saturday night (April 10th) Then I would hope to see you at the Rothick Art Haus Rebornz Room and Board show.. I swung by the gallery on Sunday with my boyfriend to drop off some of the decks he made for the show. I got a first look at the myriads of decks that were submitted by over 30 artist before they were hung.. Of course I will be here to support my beau and other friends that are showing.. Some of the artist that will be showing are Ryan Clemens, the Raw featured artist and winner of the Harvey's tote bag design Cody "Mustachio" Lusby, Aaron Kraten, Aileen Holmes, Kelly Castillo, Jason Hernandez, Jophen Stein..That is just a few of the list of the artist.. Plus, they also will have jewelry for sale and clothing.. I picked up a rad necklace the other day while we were there. Forgot the name of the artist but I rocked it today to work and got tons of compliments on it. Anyhoot Nick and Kelly owners and master minds behind Rothick Art Haus have a nice gallery rather a rad gallery yielding amazing emerging artists and established artists. . An upcoming show that will be a good one is the Glenn Arthur art show.. Not sure on what the name of the show will be but he is a great artist and a rad guy! http://www.facebook.com/pages/Glenn-Arthur/77893147622?v=info&amp;ref=ts

As with any art opening there is cocktails.. blah blah blah .. But don't come out for the cocktails come out for the art...
