It's the high desert so I wasn't expecting much but I was surprised as soon as I opened the door. This place has more stock than some of the stores near where I moved from in Rowland Heights.
They look like they have a nice variety of games, one set of desks for card games and a whole other section for tabletop gaming with tons of dungeon/building pieces to use.
Went in looking for a pretty rare Star Trek Attack Wing ship. Everywhere I've been said it was out of stock and couldn't order it, but they actually bothered to look it up for me and ordered it! So great customer service, gotta give them props for that!

Fantastic store with AMAZING customer service. You won't be disappointed stopping by, great selection of board games for the area.

These guys have an incredible selection of role playing games and Magic The Gathering! Huge gaming areas! The prices are very reasonable and the owners are very knowledgeable and super cool!

The high desert has a long history of gaming stores that try to deliver and just flop. For once though, the guys at linebreakers have gotten it right. Not only do they have a great selection at near (if not better) than online store prices, but they are actively assisting the local gaming community in creating and running gaming events, giving us a sorely needed way to connect with other players. Their tournaments and play nights are second to none I have taken part in and the staff is outstandingly friendly.

This store recently opened and if you play any type of face to face tabletop games they have you covered. Whether it be Magic the Gathering, Warhammer 40k and Fantasy, Infinity, X Wing, Dungeons and Dragons, and many other miniature and RPG's. Everyone was so welcoming and inviting.
