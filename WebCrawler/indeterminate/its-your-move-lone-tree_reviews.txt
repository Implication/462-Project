I really like this store.  This was our second trip here and both times the employees were very helpful, yet not pushy.  I'm not into gaming or things that this place specializes in so the fact that they were as helpful as they were made this an easy trip.  And the kicker here was their prices both times I assumed I would be paying way too much for what I was getting, but both times I was completely wrong.  Their prices are great.  All around a fun store worth checking out.

Love this little game shop! The staff here clearly has a genuine love of and excitement for all types of games.  They have been really helpful with all my gaming questions.  Don't miss this store! Located on the bottom level, right by Dillard's.
