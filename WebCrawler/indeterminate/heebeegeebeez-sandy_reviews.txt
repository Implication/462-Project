Nice place.  Friendly people.  Overall I give HBGBZ a thumb's up.  I'd give them a 5 star if they didn't mark up the price on variant covers upon release.  Seems to be gouging in my mind.

Oh, and they only accept credit cards above a certain amount!

The staff here is pretty annoying. I stopped by on a whim, looking for a single, specific back issue of a current series, and all the guy could do was smugly quip, "?! You're pretty late to the game, aren't you?" 

That's one way to look at it, I guess... Maybe he was trying to be funny or warm. But when he didn't offer any other information, I was left to interpret his rhetorical question as a "no."

I was only in the shop a few minutes, but I did notice that none of the books on the shelves are bagged with boards, so I guess it's just as well that they (presumably) didn't have what I wanted.

There are plenty of other, better comic stores in the area you can go to. The selection is decent but the dude manning the store is extremely nosy and in-your-face and was very patronizing about my taste in comics. He's one of those employees that act smug because he knows everything about comics and is disdainful towards the mainstream, making us mere mortals feel alienated. He also critically misunderstood the point of Watchmen and put it down by looking at it on a purely superficial level. So I guess if you don't mind that stuff you can go here. But if you want something better, hit up Dark Soldiers, Black Cat, Hastur, the Nerd Store, or any of the other great stores around. There's a variety of great places, and a larger amount if you don't mind a drive.

We've been here a few times and appreciate the dollar comics and selections. There is not as many trades and volume collections from what we were looking for, but the staff was helpful and the place is spacious.
