This place really is indescribably cool. Its full of all things that are good! Fossils and casts of fossils are EVERYWHERE. They have incredibly cool figurines, not just for gaming and other nerdy pursuits but also mythological figurines, dinosaurs, and other animals. There's also all sorts of stuff for leatherworking, crafting, and costuming; from rolls of leather and loose rivets to fully made ren-faire-ish costumery. They have a whole room dedicated to gaming where they on occasion will let a group host their table top game. The walls are lined with cards and figurines while a big plasma screen TV plays DnD themed shows. They also have a ton of cool rocks here. I even heard whispers that they plan on expanding and selling comics too. I just wish I lived closer! 

The only semi-downside I see to the place is that there is a staunch no cussing policy. SEMI downside because if you're trying to bring in your kid and don't want them around profanity then this policy was designed for you. For me and other adult gamers in my position, though, it's a bit challenging. Not all of us pay much attention to our use of profanity and it can be difficult to censor ourselves of something we are so used to doing unconsciously. No one wants to get kicked out of that awesome place for saying "crap". So when you go just be aware that you need to guard your tongue very carefully.

This place is a diamond in the rough!  My son has bought many affordable crystals here and just took a "robot" workshop class and has had a great experience each and every time!  The people who ran the workshop my son went to were kind, patient and enthusiastic educators. This is a great place for science and nature lovers.  There's a hodgepodge of stuff to explore. Parents and nerds, please come check it out and help support this place; you'll be glad you did.
