Green Tower Games has everything you could ask for in a friendly local game shop, great variety of games, large play area, friendly staff. 
The store has plenty of tables available for everyone to use, as well as loads of terrain for table top war games.

Green Tower Games is a welcome addition to our valley. Super friendly, lots of the best board games out today on their shelves, and plenty of room to sit down and play some. They seem to have a lot of war gamers, but there's always room for RPG and board game play as well. I've only been a few times, but I can tell I will be back often.

Great selection and friendly staff. Willing to order games for customers quickly. Reasonable prices as well. This is my new game spot for SCV!
