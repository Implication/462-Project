Love this place, I go here about once a month. The staff is always friendly and they have a good selection. They have a big selection of old comics and are always in stock. Would recommend to anyone.

Wow, what a gem!  I didn't know that Avalon was in town until I went to a show there (The Doubleclicks and Sammus).  They have a great selection of comics and games.  Their events seem like a lot of fun, too.

For the show, they did a great job setting everything up and providing a warm, welcoming space for a lot of people to enjoy.  The employees were all very friendly.

I'm definitely coming back here for some open gaming now that I know it's in town!

Started taking my daughter here to play games.  It has been a great place to hang out.  I've spent a year away from comics.  Since the staff reads about every series they got me caught back up and I'm back on the band wagon again.

Santa Barbara's newest comics and games store. The space is intimate and unpretentious, and is staffed by knowledgable, helpful and friendly people who are passionate about their store and stock. They are more than ready to answer questions and help you find exactly what you need or want (even if you aren't exactly sure yourself), special order any items they don't have in stock, and invite you to their gaming nights.
