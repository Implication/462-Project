I took a couple grandchildren into the store and they were having a great 1/2 off sale after Christmas.  It was a great place, I thought for them to spend some Christmas cash.  I also purchased a couple things.  An item I bought didn't work right, it was a pin-ball game that required batteries.  My husband urged me to take it back-which I really hate taking things back.  So, together, we made the journey.  When I got to the store, the lady working pointed out to me quite rudely that the date of purchase on the receipt was after 12/25/14 and that, on the receipt, was a blurb that anything bought after 12/25/14 could not be returned for a refund, but for a store credit only.  It wasn't so much that that was the case, but rather the rude tone in which it was delivered.  I had actually hoped to get a board game any way.  So, I wandered around the store about 10 times and just couldn't find anything I really wanted.  A different lady came on duty, and my husband told her my dilemma.  She was very nice and asked if it was defective.  He said yes, and that he had told the other woman that too.  The 2nd lady said there was an exception to every rule and this was one-if it was defective.  She gladly refunded my money at that point.  I was glad that the problem was worked out, but disappointed in how rude the first lady was to me.

I bought a my little pony adventure kit for 12.99$ got home was about to wrap it and the sticker under it was from Ross for 9.99$ wtf!!!!! If you're going to rip off your customers don't let them find the price tag!
