Helpful service, and everything you need to have a fun game night! I highly recommend shopping here for all your card/board games!

Was driving around with my family decided to pull into this little spot and we see this game place and my hubby and son checked it out really cool spot made them feel really comfortable and offer to show our son how to play the card game Magic. He also gave our son and daughters a free deck of cards of Magic ask us to come back Friday we will definitely be coming back

Found this game shop this past weekend on a drive from Angels Camp to the Bay Area.  I love this place, excellent selection and the person who greeted me seemed very knowledgeable and was able to help me find exactly what I was looking for.  I recommend this place for experienced and casual gamers alike, or anyone just looking for a new game.
