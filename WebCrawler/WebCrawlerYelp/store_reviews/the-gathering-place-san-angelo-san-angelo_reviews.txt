My review will have three points. The product, the facilities, and the staff! 

1) TGP really does have one of the best board game selections around. They carry sleeves for both standard and small size gaming cards, and they have a great Warhammer and paint selection. 

2) The facilities are beautiful - and they are kept clean all the time. The tables are wiped down with disinfectant daily, the floors are kept clean, and they keep the bathroom in great shape. 

3) The staff are knowledgeable and professional. They always treat you like family when you walk in the door, and if you ever need help with something, they are always willing to help. 

All in all, a great place to game! I encourage everyone to come game here. ^-^
