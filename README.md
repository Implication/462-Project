Files Contributed in the board game store application, Yelp DB files pull query requests from yelp api into a sql database, Web crawler files then go through the files in the sql database and crawl through the reviews, and then these review text files are sent into a script that determines whether they are board game stores and passes them into another sql table that is used as the offical table for the app for nearby locations of stores. Stores range from all of the united states with over 100 returned addresses.
